Arrow Stand
===========

Welcome to Arrow Stand, a browser-based game created as an experiment with ChatGPT.

About the Game
--------------

Arrow Stand is a strategy game where players defend their territory by placing arrow shooters on a map. Once the attack begins, the shooters remain fixed while attackers try to destroy them. The attackers cannot shoot back and will only attack the closest arrow shooter. The goal is to strategically place your shooters to reach 2000 points.

Experiment with ChatGPT
-----------------------

This game was developed as part of an experiment to see how effectively ChatGPT could assist in creating a game from scratch. The entire process, from initial concept to final implementation, involved extensive use of ChatGPT for generating code, design ideas, and technical solutions.
