- Switches styles: ' -> " and vice versa (https://github.com/bukov-ka/ArrowStand/commit/7c3841bbff3a8db2d75a63537299a2e48d4fc9de)
   Couldn't maintain strict typing

- Sometimes rolls back the latest changes (extracting some logic into a separate class)


- Some files become too lengthty and take too long to be re-generated each time
It's s good thing that the whole file is regenerated. Easier to make changes.

- The long context window is a bomb. 'Continue generating' and that's it

- HTML design is still bad
