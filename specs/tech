Technical Specifications for "Arrow Stand"General Requirements:Platform: Browser-based gameProgramming Language: TypeScriptHosting: AWSFramework and Libraries:Game Engine: PhaserUI Library: ReactState Management: ZustandSound Management: Howler.jsProject Structure:Frontend:Game Engine Integration: Set up Phaser for the game canvas and core gameplay logic.UI Components: Use React for menus, HUD, and level editor.State Management: Implement state management using Zustand.Audio: Integrate Howler.js for sound effects and music.Backend:Hosting: Use AWS services such as S3 for static content, Lambda for serverless functions (if needed), and CloudFront for CDN.Database: Use DynamoDB or S3 for storing level data and player progress.Detailed Components:Game Initialization:Load assets (images, sounds) and initialize the game canvas with Phaser.Set up the game scene and static map.Placement Phase:Display a scalable map using Phaser.Use React to list available shooters and display the current gold budget.Allow the player to place shooters by clicking on the map. Validate placement (e.g., not on obstacles, within budget).Battle Phase:Start the attack and manage waves of attackers with Phaser.Implement shooter attack logic (e.g., targeting, shooting, reload times) within Phaser.Handle attacker movement and health using Phaser's physics and game loop.Update health indicators for shooters and attackers using React.Implement win/lose conditions and timeout logic.User Interface:Main Menu: Implement with React, providing options for level selection and game settings.In-Game HUD: Display health indicators, gold budget, and remaining time using React components.End-of-Level Summary: Show win/lose screens with React.Audio:Load and play background music for different phases using Howler.js.Play sound effects for shooting and hits with Howler.js.Manage audio settings (e.g., volume control).Level Editor:Create a simple interface with React to draw terrain and place enemies.Save and load level configurations using AWS S3 or DynamoDB.Development Workflow:Version Control: Use GitHub for version control.Project Setup:Initialize a new TypeScript project.Set up Phaser, React, Zustand, and Howler.js.Configure AWS S3 for static content hosting.Feature Development:Implement game initialization and asset loading.Develop the placement phase with React and Phaser.Create the battle phase logic in Phaser.Build the UI components with React.Integrate sound management with Howler.js.Develop the level editor with React.Testing:Perform unit testing for game logic.Conduct integration testing for the game phases.User acceptance testing to ensure the game meets gameplay expectations.Deployment:Deploy static content to AWS S3.Use AWS CloudFront for CDN distribution```
